# shape_detector
A browser-based shape detection system that identifies circles, triangles, rectangles, pentagons, and stars from image pixel data. Uses grayscale conversion, thresholding, connected components, and geometric analysis. No CV libraries or ML models used; classification is based on contour and shape properties.

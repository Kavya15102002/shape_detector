# shape_detector
This project implements a complete geometric shape detection system capable of identifying and classifying shapes such as circles, triangles, rectangles, pentagons, and stars from image data. The solution processes raw pixel data without using any external computer vision libraries, instead relying on core image processing operations and mathematical shape analysis. The detection pipeline includes grayscale conversion, thresholding, connected-component extraction, boundary tracing, convex hull estimation, and vertex-based classification. It is designed to handle clean shapes, noisy scenes, overlapping objects, and rotated shapes while producing precise bounding boxes, center coordinates, area calculations, and confidence scores. This project was created as part of a technical evaluation challenge, following strict constraints and performance requirements.
